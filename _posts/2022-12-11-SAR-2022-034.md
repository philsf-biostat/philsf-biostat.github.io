Residents in the UK were invited to participate in a survey that presents a fictional scenario where they received an e-mail from an institution declaring that their personal data is being collected for an explicit purpose.
In the survey their concerns on privacy issues is assessed based on the scenario they were given.
Scenarios include all combinations between two factors: three institutions (government agency, known and recognizable private company and unknown private company) and five purposes (inform, understand, sell, persuade and experiment).
The survey measured their perspectives on three dimensions: safety, creepiness and motivation to interrupt the collection of personal data.

The objective of this analysis is to predict the strength of association between privacy concerns and both different institutions and purposes of data collection in individuals based in the UK.
