This is a retrospective cohort study which will use individual de-identified patient data stored within the electronic database of Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest of Israel's four state-mandated health service organizations.
Roughly 55% of Israel's populations are insured by this medical provider by a nation-wide spread network, across 9 geographically based districts, of nearly 1,500 primary care clinics and specialist centers.
Moreover, CHS owns and operates 14 hospitals across the country, which account for about a third of Israel's total inpatient hospital capacity.
These hospitals provide emergency and elective medical services to any patient, irrespective of their medical insurance affiliation.
Keeping in mind that medical insurance is mandatory by law in Israel for all its citizens, this database holds potential information which can reflect extensive continuum of care encountered throughout an individual's life together with exhaustive detailing of relevant clinical data.

The objective of the study is to determine the age-adjusted incidence rate ratio of lower extremity amputation across varying BMI groups in patients with dysvascular disease in Israel.
